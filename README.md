## About
The app in itself is a simple shopping app. Clicking the product list item it shows the detail of the product. While this is not an extremely complex app, it isn't a silly Hello World one either, so the hope is that it'll cover regular use cases for a basic application.


## Sailent Features:
- Search the products.
- Buy products.
